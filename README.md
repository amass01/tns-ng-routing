# Angular Routing inside NativeScript app



In an Angular application navigation is done using the **Angular Component Router**.


### Configuration

The router configuration usually consists of the following steps:

* Create a **RouterConfig** object which maps paths to components and parameters:

```
export const routes = [
   { path: "login", component: LoginComponent },
   { path: "groceries", component: GroceryListComponent },
   { path: "grocery/:id", component: GroceryComponent }
];
```

* Use the **NativeScriptRouterModule** API to import your routes:

```
import { NativeScriptRouterModule } from "nativescript-angular/router";

@NgModule({
    bootstrap: [GroceriesApp],
    imports: [
        NativeScriptRouterModule,
        NativeScriptRouterModule.forRoot(routes)
    ]
})
export class GroceriesAppModule { }
```

*  Pass your module to the **bootstrapModule** function to start your app

### Pages


NativeScript apps consist of pages which represent the separate application screens.
Pages are instances of the Page class.
Page navigation integrates with the native navigation elements on the current platform (ex. the Back button in Android or the NavigationBar in iOS).


In NativeScript you have a choice between two router outlets:

* router-outlet - replaces the content of the outlet with different component. It is the default outlet that comes from Angular.
* page-router-outlet - uses pages to navigate. The new components are shown in a new page.

### Router Links

```
@Component({
    selector: "second",
    template: `
        <StackLayout>
            <Label text="Second component" class="title"></Label>
            <Button text="GO TO FIRST" [nsRouterLink]="['/first']" class="link"></Button>
        </StackLayout>
    `
})
```

One thing you might have noticed in the code above is the **nsRouterLink** directive. It is similar to routerLink, but works with NativeScript navigation.
To use it, you need to import **NativeScriptRouterModule** in your NgModule.

### Router Outlet

```
template: `
        <StackLayout>
            <StackLayout class="nav">
                <Button text="First"
                    [nsRouterLink]="['/first']"></Button>
                <Button text="Second"
                    [nsRouterLink]="['/second']"></Button>
            </StackLayout>

            <router-outlet></router-outlet>
        </StackLayout>
    `
```

The result is that with each navigation the content of the **router-outlet** is replaced with the new component.

### Page Router Outlet

```
@Component({
    selector: "page-navigation-test",
    template: `<page-router-outlet></page-router-outlet>`
})
export class PageNavigationApp {
}

@NgModule({
    declarations: [PageNavigationApp, FirstComponent, SecondComponent],
    bootstrap: [PageNavigationApp],
    imports: [
        NativeScriptModule,
        NativeScriptRouterModule,
        NativeScriptRouterModule.forRoot(routes)
    ]
})
export class PageNavigationAppModule { }

platformNativeScriptDynamic().bootstrapModule(PageNavigationAppModule);
```

The main difference here is that when navigating - the new component will be loaded as a root view in a **new Page**.
This means that any content outside the **page-router-outlet** will not be included in the new page. This is the reason why the **page-router-outlet** is usually the single root element in the application component.

Note that we can now use the **Back** button and the **NavigationBar** to navigate.

It is possible to nest <router-outlet> component inside **page-router-outlet** or another **router-outlet**.

### Navigation Options

You can define the trigger in your application declaratively - using the **nsRouterLink** directive in your markup. Or you can do it through code - by injecting the **RouterExtensions** class and using its methods:

```
@Component({
    // ...
})
export class MainComponent {
    constructor(private routerExtensions: RouterExtensions) {
        // ...
    }
}
```

#### Navigating Back

You can navigate back using **back()** method of the **RouterExtensions**

```
public goBack() {
    this.routerExtensions.back();
}
```

You can also navigate back to the previous page with **backToPreviousPage**():

```
public goBackPage() {
    this.routerExtensions.backToPreviousPage();
}
```

The difference between the two methods is visible when there are nested(child) router-outlet(s) inside the current page:

* **back()** - goes back to the previous router location even if the navigation occurred inside the child router outlet on the current page.
* **backToPreviousPage()** - goes back to the previous page. The method skips all child router-outlet navigations inside the current page and goes directly to the previous one.

### Clearing Page Navigation History

In NativeScript's page navigation, you have the option to navigate to another page and clear the page navigation history. This means that the user will not be able to go back using the back button (or swipe back in iOS). This is useful in scenarios where you have a login page and you don't want users to be able go go back to it once logged in.

You can specify **clearHistory** as an attribute on your **nsRouterLink** tag in the markup:
```
<Button text="login" [nsRouterLink]="['/main']" clearHistory="true"></Button>
```

Or you can use **RouterExtensions** class:
```
login() {
    // app logic here ...
    this.routerExtensions.navigate(["/main"], { clearHistory: true });
}
```

### Specifying Page Transitions

By default, all navigation will be animated and will use the default transition for the respective platform (UINavigationController transitions for iOS and Fragment transitions for Android).
To change the transition type, set the **pageTransition** attribute on your **nsRouterLink** tag in the markup:
```
<Button text="flip to next" [nsRouterLink]="['/main']" pageTransition="flip"></Button>
<Button text="no transition" [nsRouterLink]="['/main']" pageTransition="none"></Button>
```

You can also do this through code using the **RouterExtensions** class:
```
flipToNextPage() {
    this.routerExtensions.navigate(["/main"], {
        transition: {
            name: "flip",
            duration: 2000,
            curve: "linear"
        }
    });
}
```

### Route Guards

You can use Angularâ€™s [route guards](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/router.html#!#guards) for even more control over the navigation.

### Lifecycle Hooks And Component Caching

There is a difference in the component lifecycle when using **page-router-outlet** and **router-outlet**.

With <router-outlet> new instance of the component is created with each navigation and is destroyed when you navigate to another component. The component's constructor and its init hooks will be called every time you navigate to the component and ngOnDestroy() will be called every time you navigate away from it.

With <page-router-outlet> when you navigate forward, the current page and views are saved in the native navigation stack. The corresponding component is not destroyed. It is cached, so that it can be shown when you go back to the same page. It will still be connected to the views that were cached natively.
